                    Hello! <br />
                    <p> <strong>Programming Languages</strong></p>
                    
                    <p> Programming languages are essentially the medium between you<br />
                    and computers. They are the set of instructions that allow to do <br />
                    to do cool things such as the ones that were mentioned in the home <br />
                    page. Programming has been around since the first computers were uprisen <br />
                    and have allowed people to do amazing things with them.</p>
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    <p>Things such as a remoteless r/c car, magic mirror, and self driven <br />
                    drones have all had their base on some programming language. All these things <br />
                    and many more are achievable through coding and the range of possibilities <br />
                    will only expand with more people diving into the field.</p>
                    
                    <p>Truthfully without computers and programming we wouldn't have some of the most essential <br />
                    things that we have now such as phones, TVs, we would not be able to ride an <br />
                    elevator, or even take a hot shower. Programming is essential in this day and <br />
                    age and it is important to get as many people into it as possible.</p>
