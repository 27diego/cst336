            <p>Not only is programming fun to do, it is a big part of the job <br />
            market, and it is only increasing as the years go by. Even though there <br />
            has been a bigger emphasis on incouraging more people to get into this <br />
            field, womens in the workforce of programming seem to be decreasing as the <br />
            demand for computer scientists increase.</p>

            <p>This table shows the decline in programming for women from the 1980's <br />
            but has been increasing from the low 2000's. Still we encourage more women <br />
            give this a try because it is important to not only have cultural diversity in <br />
            the work force, it is important to have gender diversity as well.</p>
            
            <p>The job market for this profession has been increasing as the years go by. <br />
            The demand has been steadily going upward. It has been one of the fastest growing <br />
            markets in the US so far and is only growing more.</p>
