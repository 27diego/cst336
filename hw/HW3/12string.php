            <p>	The GPC12PA4 is the first 12-string in the popular Performing Artist Series. 
            This model features fast and comfortable High Performance necks, and Fishman's F1 
            Analog electronics. Perfect for any performing artist. The back and sides are of 
            solid sapele with a solid sitka spruce top for a bright, balanced sound. The 25.4 
            in. scale-length neck is made of stable hardwood and features a black Richlite 
            fingerboard with white Boltaron position inlays. Includes case.</p>

            <img src="images/taylorfull12string.jpg" width="230">   
            <p>The slightly broader waist of the Dreadnought shape helps bring out 
            the lower midrange frequencies. On a 12-string, it generates a thick, 
            husky midrange power that complements the crispness and shimmer of the 
            octave strings. The wood pairing of blackwood and mahogany on the 360e 
            yields a smooth response that promises to deliver a bold and balanced sound.
            We have the cutaway and the full body in stock.</p>

            Takamine split-saddle bone bridge provides faultless intonation and excellent acoustic

            rosewood fingerboard with wood œdot-in-dot. inlays, gold tuners with amber buttons, 
            natural satin finish and the highly acclaimed CT4B II preamp system with three-band EQ, 
            volume control and built-in tuner. CT4B II Preamp Features The CT4B II preamp is designed 
            for ease of use and purity of tone. The CT4B II consists of 3 bands of graphic EQ tone 
            control, a volume control slider and a built-in chromatic tuner. The 3 band EQ provides 
            control over the bass (LOW), midrange (MID) and treble (HIGH) frequency response. 
            With the sliders set at the midpoint (0) the electric signal from the guitar is evenly 
            balanced across the frequency range. The desired tone is then dialed in by using the 
            sliders to add or subtract frequency response as desired. Each frequency control slider
            will raise or lower the band response by +/-5db. We have the cutaway and the full body in stock.</p>
