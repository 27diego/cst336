            <h2>Repairs</h2>
            <div id = "repairs">
                <p>Got a crack in your axe? If your guitar has suffered an injury, 
                if it’s buzzing, or hard to play, or even if it won’t make any 
                sound at all, we can probably help. We have a team of veteran 
                luthiers who know what they’re doing. Restrings, new gears, pickup 
                installation, troubleshooting – “No job too weird or too small” is 
                what our repair shop motto would be, if we had a repair shop motto. 
                And there is never a charge for estimates or advice.</p>
