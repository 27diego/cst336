            <p>We've got a team of veteran 
            technicians who know what they're doing here at Diego's guitar shop. Bring your instrument in and see Doug 
            (M-F, 10-6), Jody (M-Thu, 11-7), or Mike (Tue-Sat, 10-6 except Wed when he works 5-10pm) 
            for a free consultation. You can also send an e-mail with any 
            repair questions you may have (but it's usually easier if you just bring it in). 
            Restrings, new gears, pickup installation, troubleshooting - "No job too weird or 
            too small" is what our motto would be, if we had a motto. No charge for estimates 
            or advice.</p>
