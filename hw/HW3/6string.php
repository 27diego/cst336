            <p>The D-21 Special is a limited edition dreadnought that is limited to 300 guitars. 
            The D-21 Special is rich with East Indian Rosewood which is used not only for the back, 
            sides, and headplate but also for the fingerboard and bridge. Other unique features are 
            the nickel open-gear tuners and black binding around the entire body of the guitar. The 
            D-21 Special includes a Sitka spruce top with forward-shifted scalloped bracing, a 
            traditional hand-fit dovetail neck, and a polished gloss finish. Some modern touches 
            include a modern belly drop-in saddle and a high performance neck, for enhanced playability 
            and comfort. As of now we only offer the full body dreadnought.</p>
            
            <h2>Taylor</h2>

            <p>This fingerstyle-friendly Grand Concert boasts the classic tonewood pairing of 
            solid Indian rosewood back and sides with a Sitka spruce top, and like other Grand 
            Concert body styles, features a slightly shorter 24-7/8-inch scale length to make 
            reaching and fretting notes easier. The compact body is matched by a sonic footprint 
            that will keep the overtones in check, giving the guitar clear tonal definition that 
            works well both for solo and ensemble playing. Taylor’s Expression System® 2 pickup 
            delivers natural-sounding amplified tone for gigging or recording. Aesthetic details 
            include white binding, Renaissance fretboard inlays, a three-ring rosette, and satin 
            finish back and sides with a gloss top. The guitar ships in a Taylor deluxe hardshell 
            case. We have the cutaway and the full body in stock.</p>

            <p>The Artwood Vintage series now showcases another vintage element by applying an 
            "aging" process to the tonewood : "Thermo Aged™" tone wood, made by a special drying 
            process at a high temperature which is commonly known as "baking" or "torrefaction." 
            We have both the full body dreadnought and the cutaway in stock.</p>

            <p>First introduced in 2003, the Songwriter Deluxe Studio combines Gibson’s 
            time-honored bracing patterns of the 1930’s with our original dreadnought shape, 
            providing a supreme tonal quality. Featuring beautiful rosewood back and sides 
            paired with a sitka spruce top. The Songwriter Deluxe Studio is Gibson’s modern 
            rosewood dreadnought with a superior dynamic range. We have both
