                    Hello! <br />
                    <p> Thank you for being interested in programming.</p>
                    
                    <p> I am a Software Engineer & CSUMB and am trying to get <br />
                    more people to try coding for the first time.</p>
                    
                    <p> Programming may look a bit intimidating at first but it is <br />
                    very fun and rewarding once you get your feet wet. It is very diverse <br />
                    as well with over 9 programming languages you could choose to suit <br />
                    your style with.</p>
                    
                    <p>With programming, a lot of things could be done such as photoshop in <br />
                    python, games such as tron in c++, or even design android apps with java <br />
                    plus much more.</p>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>I hope that this website encourages you to learn programming and seek a <br />
                    future with it involved.</p>
